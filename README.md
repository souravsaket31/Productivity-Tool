# Productivity-Tool
It's coded in python which will block websites from us while we are during our working hours.
This program runs in background and we can set a certain time frame. For that I have imported a timedate library as well and
by setting the time frame we are telling the program from this time to this time block these following sites.
And when that time is up then I want to have access to websites again.
## Prerequists: 
1. Python Basics (modules, file-handling, basic python data structures)
2. Access to host file, which is present in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts Directory
3. Need to run the command and give Administration perission as we are working with the System File.
